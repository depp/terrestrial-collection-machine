# Terrestrial Collection Machine

Terrestrial Collection Machine (TCM) is a demo for the [Demosplash 2019][demosplash] demo party, which takes place on November 8-9, 2019 in Pittsburgh, PA. Yes, that doesnâ€™t give us much time.

## Building

Required software for building:

- [Bazel 1.0](https://bazel.build/)

To build, run:

```shell
bazel build //tcm
```

This will create the executable `bazel-bin/tcm/tcm`.

Tip for Googlers: You may want to `alias blaze=bazel` in your profile, or `alias bazel=blaze` in your profile at work.
